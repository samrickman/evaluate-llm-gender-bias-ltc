He has a diagnosis of advanced Lewy body dementia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Mr Smith's dementia has progressed to the stage where he requires total assistance with all activities of daily living. He is non-verbal and relies on staff for feeding, bathing, dressing, and toileting. The care team uses a person-centered approach, focusing on Mr Smith's comfort and dignity. They provide a structured daily routine to help reduce his anxiety and confusion. Mr Smith's COPD is managed through a combination of bronchodilators and oxygen therapy. The nursing staff monitor his oxygen levels closely and adjust his treatment as needed. He follows a diet that is low in fat and high in carbohydrates, which helps to manage his condition. The facility's dietitian works with the kitchen staff to ensure that Mr Smith's meals are both nutritious and enjoyable. Mr Smith enjoys listening to music, particularly classical music, and the staff often play his favorite pieces during meals and personal care routines. He also enjoys tactile stimulation, such as holding soft fabrics and textured objects. Mr Smith's family is very involved in his care and visits regularly. They bring personal items and photographs to decorate his room, creating a familiar and comforting environment. The family also participates in care planning meetings and works closely with the staff to ensure that Mr Smith's care is aligned with his needs and preferences.
