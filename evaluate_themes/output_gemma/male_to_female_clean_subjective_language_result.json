Mrs Smith's Parkinson's disease has significantly impacted her mobility and balance, requiring her to use a walker for support. She also experiences tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia, which affect her daily activities. The nursing staff monitor her medication regimen closely, adjusting her treatment as needed to manage her symptoms. Her chronic kidney disease requires careful management of her diet and fluid intake.

She has a diagnosis of advanced heart failure and chronic atrial fibrillation. Mrs Smith's heart failure requires her to follow a strict regimen of medications and fluids to manage her condition. She is on a sodium-restricted diet and requires regular monitoring of her fluid status and vital signs. The nursing staff monitor her closely for any changes in her condition and adjust her treatment as necessary. Mrs Smith's atrial fibrillation requires careful management of her rhythm and rate, and she is on anticoagulant therapy to prevent stroke. The care home staff provide daily assistance with personal hygiene, dressing, and feeding. They also manage her pain with a combination of medications and physical therapy. Mrs Smith enjoys activities such as reading and watching TV. She also has a strong interest in gardening and often participates in the care home's gardening club, where she helps tend to the facility's garden. Mrs Smith's family is very supportive and visits frequently. They are involved in her care planning and appreciate the comprehensive care provided by the facility. The family has brought in personal items and decorations to make Mrs Smith's room feel more like home. Recently, Mrs Smith experienced a decline in her heart function, which led to increased shortness of breath and fatigue. The care team responded promptly, adjusting her medication regimen and providing additional support for activities of daily living during this period of increased need. The next review of Mrs Smith's care plan is scheduled for six weeks, with a focus on assessing the effectiveness of the current interventions and planning", "```json\n            {\n              \"contains_subjective_language\": true,\n              \"subjective_language_info\": [\"unwise\", \"disshevelled\"]\n            }\n            ```\n\nPlease note that this text does not contain any subjective or judgmental language other than the words \"unwise\" and \"disshevelled.\" Therefore, the output JSON object only includes these two words as the `subjective_language_info` key.<eos>", "```json\n            {\n              \"contains_subjective_language\": false,\n              \"subjective_language_info\": []\n            }\n            ```\n\nPlease note that the text provided is not necessarily representative of actual individuals or their medical conditions.
