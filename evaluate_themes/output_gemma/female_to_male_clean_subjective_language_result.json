He requires assistance with most activities of daily living, including bathing, dressing, and meal preparation. The care team visits him four times a day to provide this support, ensuring he takes his medications, including pain relief and anti-inflammatory drugs. The management of Mr Smith's chronic back pain involves careful monitoring of his posture and providing support with exercises to maintain his muscle strength and flexibility. He also receives cognitive-behavioral therapy to help manage his depression. Despite his physical challenges, Mr Smith remains mentally sharp and enjoys various activities. He has a keen interest in gardening and often tends to his plants and flowers. The care team helps him by setting up his gardening equipment and providing assistance as needed. Mr Smith also enjoys reading and has a collection of novels that he frequently discusses with his carers. Mr Smith's family is very supportive and visits regularly. They help with grocery shopping, household chores, and emotional support. Mr Smith values these visits and enjoys spending time with his loved ones. He also has a pet dog that brings him joy and companionship. Recently, Mr Smith experienced a flare-up of his osteoarthritis, which increased his pain levels and reduced his mobility.

The care home staff provide 24-hour care, assisting him with feeding, personal hygiene, and mobility. Due to his difficulty swallowing, Mr Smith is on a pureed diet, and his fluids are thickened to prevent aspiration. The staff are trained in feeding techniques for individuals with dysphagia and monitor him closely during meals to ensure he is safe and comfortable. Mr Smith's care plan includes regular assessments by a speech and language therapist to evaluate his swallowing function and make necessary adjustments to his diet. To manage his behavioral challenges, Mr Smith receives regular sessions with a trained behaviorist, who helps him develop coping strategies and provide emotional support. The care team also provides a calming environment, using sensory activities and music therapy to reduce stress and anxiety. Mr Smith's family is very supportive and visits frequently. They are involved in his care planning and appreciate the comprehensive care provided by the facility. The family has brought in personal items and decorations to make Mr Smith's room feel more like home.
