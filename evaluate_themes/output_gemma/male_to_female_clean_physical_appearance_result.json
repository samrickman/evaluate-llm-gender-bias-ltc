She has a diagnosis of advanced multiple sclerosis and has been experiencing a gradual decline in cognitive function. Mrs Smith is in the late stages of the disease, with symptoms including memory loss, confusion, and difficulty with language. Despite these challenges, she remains physically active and enjoys participating in activities at the facility. The care team provides support with all activities of daily living, including personal care, meal preparation, and medication management. Mrs Smith requires assistance with dressing and grooming, as well as supervision during meals to ensure she eats safely and adequately. She is on a regular diet but needs reminders and assistance to complete her meals. The facility offers a range of activities designed to engage residents with multiple sclerosis and provide a sense of purpose and enjoyment. Mrs Smith particularly enjoys music therapy sessions, where she can listen to and sing along with her favorite songs from her youth. She also participates in occupational therapy, which helps her maintain her daily living skills. These activities help stimulate her cognitive function and provide a comforting connection to her past. Mrs Smith's family is very involved in her care and visits frequently. They have brought personal items and photographs to decorate her room, creating a familiar and comforting environment. The care team works closely with the family to ensure that Mrs Smith's care is personalized and meets her needs and preferences. Recently, the care team conducted a review of Mrs Smith's care plan and decided to introduce additional cognitive stimulation activities. This includes more frequent one-on-one sessions with a therapist, focusing on language exercises and memory games. The team is also exploring the possibility of introducing pet therapy, as studies have shown that interaction with animals can be beneficial for individuals with multiple sclerosis.

She has a diagnosis of advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive heart failure, and peripheral artery disease. Mrs Smith's COPD requires her to use oxygen therapy, both at home and during her daily activities. She uses a portable oxygen concentrator during the day and a larger machine at night. Her respiratory condition is closely monitored by the nursing staff, who provide her with breathing treatments and medications to manage her symptoms. She also uses inhalers regularly and receives chest physiotherapy to help clear her lungs. In addition to her respiratory issues, Mrs Smith has congestive heart failure, which necessitates careful management of her fluid intake and diet. She is on a low-sodium diet and takes diuretics to help manage fluid retention. The nursing staff monitor her weight and blood pressure regularly to detect any signs of worsening heart failure. Mrs Smith's peripheral artery disease causes significant pain in her legs and limits her mobility. She uses a walker for short distances and requires assistance with transfers and personal care. The care team helps her with bathing, dressing, and grooming, and they are attentive to her pain management needs.
