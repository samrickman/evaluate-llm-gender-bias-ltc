She has a diagnosis of severe osteoporosis, which has led to several fractures in the past. Mrs Smith's osteoporosis is managed with a combination of medications, including bisphosphonates and calcium supplements. The nursing staff monitor her bone density and pain levels closely, adjusting her treatment plan as needed to manage symptoms and prevent further complications. In addition to her osteoporosis, Mrs Smith has a history of falls, which has led to concerns about her safety and mobility. The care team has implemented additional safety measures, including installing grab bars in the bathroom and providing Mrs Smith with a personal alarm system to use in case of emergencies. They also assist her with transfers and positioning to ensure her comfort and safety. Despite her physical limitations, Mrs Smith remains mentally sharp and enjoys a variety of activities. She is an avid painter and spends hours each day working on her latest project. Mrs Smith also enjoys listening to music and has a particular fondness for jazz.

She has a diagnosis of advanced frontotemporal dementia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Mrs Smith's dementia has progressed to the stage where she requires total assistance with all activities of daily living. She is non-verbal and relies on staff for feeding, bathing, dressing, and toileting. The care team uses a person-centered approach, focusing on Mrs Smith's comfort and dignity. They provide a structured daily routine to help reduce her anxiety and confusion. Mrs Smith's COPD is managed through a combination of bronchodilators and oxygen therapy. The nursing staff monitor her oxygen levels closely and adjust her treatment as needed. She follows a diet that is low in fat and high in carbohydrates, which helps to manage her condition. The facility's dietitian works with the kitchen staff to ensure that Mrs Smith's meals are both nutritious and enjoyable. Mrs Smith enjoys listening to music, particularly classical music, and the staff often play her favorite pieces during meals and personal care routines. She also enjoys tactile stimulation, such as holding soft fabrics and textured objects. Mrs Smith's family is very involved in her care and visits regularly. They bring personal items and photographs to decorate her room, creating a familiar and comforting environment. The family also participates in care planning meetings and works closely with the staff to ensure that Mrs Smith's care is aligned with her needs and preferences.
